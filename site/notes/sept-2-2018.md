Main site done.

Done:

- Core components
- Main page
- netlify deploy

todo:

- netlify cms
- GQL from CMS.
- standard "coming soon" page for all other routes
- modal for main page? Blah.
- storybook.
- Lazy load all SVG. Use https://github.com/jasonslyvia/react-lazyload
- standardize components with core props ex. accepting margin, marginMobile, flex, etc. have all non text based components inherit this prototype.

Woo!
