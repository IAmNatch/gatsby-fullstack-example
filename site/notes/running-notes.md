Main site done.

TODO:

- clean up CMS categories a bit.
- storybook.
- modal for main page? Blah. // For now I put a silly alert message.
- Testing? Maybe jest + enzyme, though I'd really like to play with cypress it looks so cool.

DONE:

- Core components
- Main page
- netlify deploy
- standard "coming soon" page for all other routes
- Lazy load all SVG. Use https://github.com/jasonslyvia/react-lazyload
- netlify cms
- GQL from CMS.
- Move list to components
- standardize components with core props ex. accepting margin, marginMobile, flex, etc. have all wrapper level components inherit this prototype.

Woo!

THURSDAY:

- DEAL with all the component level tasks
- storybook.
