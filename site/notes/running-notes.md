Main site done.

Done:

- Core components
- Main page
- netlify deploy
- standard "coming soon" page for all other routes
- Lazy load all SVG. Use https://github.com/jasonslyvia/react-lazyload
- netlify cms
- GQL from CMS.

todo:

- clean up CMS categories a bit.
- modal for main page? Blah. // For now I put a silly alert message.
- Move list to components
- storybook.
- standardize components with core props ex. accepting margin, marginMobile, flex, etc. have all non text based components inherit this prototype.

Woo!

THURSDAY:
 // DEAL with all the component level tasks + storybook.
